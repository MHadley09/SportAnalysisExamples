[Here is the official ballot for those who want the pretty website and abridged explanation.](https://poll.redditcfb.com/ballot/31911/)

For those interested here is my top 25 with a breakdown by each polls votes.  This week 2 new polls were added.  As always, each poll receives a single vote, voting for only their top 25 using the same point system as the AP poll.  Points are then divided by the maximum possible points to get each team's score.  The human poll is the first tie breaker, and the MLE poll is the second tie breaker. The polls are explained along with some notes below.

**Important note this week:** A bug was found in the Page model where the win matrix was being updated based on an old version of the loss matrix rather than the previous win matrix in certain situations.  This was causing a bug in the loss accountability function.  This has been resolved, but should explain some wonky rankings from earlier in the season.  There may be other changes to this and other models before the final poll.

^*: NR stands for not ranked the given poll.

This week everything ran smoothly and even got a few minor buts worked out.  The max score going forward will be 1.00 for all first place.  Scores will be the percentage of the maximum possible points received that week. Every poll receives a single vote.  All models are completely unseeded.  The models returning from last week are the Page, MLE, QELO, Skill, Naive SoR, Wins Over, Margin, Power Rank, SimuRank, Future Skill, and Future models.    Explanations are available for all 11 models.

[An overview of every poll can be found below in this comment.]()

[The other teams receiving votes in at least one model, but not scoring well enough to be ranked are in this comment below.]()

If you have any questions or comments please let me know.  I will happily discuss my rankings or expound on the concepts driving each individual computer model.  If you think any model types are not properly represented, let me know and I will try to put my own style and touch on them.
